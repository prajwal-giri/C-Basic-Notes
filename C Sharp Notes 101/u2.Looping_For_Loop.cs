// Loops allow you to execute a single statement or a block of statements repetitively.

// The most common uses of loop include displaying a series of numbers and taking repetitive input.

// In software programming, a loop construct contains a condition that helps the compiler identity the number 
// of times a specific block will be executed.

// If the condition is not specified, the loop continues infinitely and is termed as infinite loop.

// The loop constructs are also reffered as iteration statements.

// C# supports four types of loop constructs such as:

// * For loop
// * While Loop
// * Do While Loop
// * For each Loop

// The for statement is similar to the while statement in its function.

// The statements within the body of the loop are executed as long the condition is true.

// Here too, the condition is checked before the statements are executed.
