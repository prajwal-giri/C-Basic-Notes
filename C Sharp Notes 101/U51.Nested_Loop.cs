// When one for loop is enclosed inside another loop , the loops are said to be nested.

// The for loop that encloses the other for loop is referred to as the outer for loop wheraes the 
// enclosed for loop is referred to as the inner for loop.

// The outer for loop determines the number of times the inner for loop will be invoked.
