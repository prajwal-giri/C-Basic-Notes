// C# is designed to be simple, modern, general purpose, object-oriented programming language, borrowing key concepts from several
// other languages , mostly notably java.


// C# was developed by Andres Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.

// We can use C# for building variety applications.

// Windows Application 
// Mobile Application
// Web Application
// Gaming Application


// Applications written in C# requires the .net core to be installed on the computer running the application. While the .NET 
// makes it possible to use a wide range of languages.

// .NET is a programming framework created by microsoft that developers can use to create applications more easily.

// A framework is just a bunch of code that the programmer can call without having to write it explicitly.

// It provides a controlled programming environment where software can be developed, installed and executed on any systems.

// It is basically a collection of libraries .

// Is a programming platform that is used for developing Desktop Apps , Web-based and mobile software.

// It has a number of pre-coded solutions that manage the execution of programs written specifically for the framework.

// A programmer can develop applications using one of the languages supported by .NET

// C# has features common to most object oriented programming languages.

// It has language specific features, such as :
// * Type safety checking
// * Generics
// * Indexers



//  Several C# features help create robust and durable applications.

// Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.
// Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.
// Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery
// Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques.
// Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. 
// Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a unified type system.
// Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types.
// C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. 
//  C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance
// C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.

/*C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#'s design that were 
directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method overload 
resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.*/
