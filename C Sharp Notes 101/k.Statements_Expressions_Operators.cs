// Statements ,Expressions and Operators

// A C# program is a set of tasks that perform to achieve the overall functionality of the program.

// To perform the tasks,programmers provide instructions . These instructions are called statements.

// A C# statement can contain expressions that evaluates to a value.

// Statements are referred to a logical grouping of variables, operators and C# keywords that perform a specific task.

// For example, the line which initializes a variable by assigning it a value is a statement.

// In C# , a statement ends with a semicolon.

// A C# program contains multiple statements grouped in blocks. A block is a code segment enclosed in culry braces.
// A block is also called scope.


// The set of statements included in the Main() method of a C# code is a block.


// STATEMENTS 

// Statements are used to specify the input, the process , and the output of a program. Statements can consist of:

// Data Types
// Variables
// Operators
// Constants
// Literals         // int a = 5;  here 5 is literal.  // int is data type // a is varibale name.
// Keywords
// Escape sequence characters


// Statements help you build a logical flow in the program. With the help of statements, you can 

//* initialize variables and objects
//* take the input
//* call a method of a class
//* Display the output


// Statements are categorized into 7 :

//* Selection Statements(if/else/switch)
//* Iteration Statements(for/while)
//* Jump Statements(break,continue)
//* Exception Handling Statements(try catch)

//* 
//*
//*

// EXPRESSIONS

// Expressions are used to manipulate data. Like in Maths, expressions in programming languages 
// are constructed from the operands and operators.


// OPERATORS

// Expressions in C# comprise one or more operators that perform some operations on varibles.
// the symbol is called an operator and the action is performed on operands.

// Major 6 Types of OPERATORS (unary,binary,ternary operators also)

//* Arithmentic Operators
//* Relational 
//* Logical
//* Bitwise 
//* Conditional
//* Increment and Decrement Operators
//* Assignment Operators
